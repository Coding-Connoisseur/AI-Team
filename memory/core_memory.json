This should include elements like a text input field for user messages, a display area for conversation history, and send/clear buttons.\n\n5. **Generate UI Code**: Save your Glade project and import it into your Python project. This will generate the necessary code for your UI.\n\n6. **Implement ChatGPT API**: In your Python project, write code to interact with the ChatGPT API. This will involve sending HTTP requests to the API endpoint and handling the responses.\n\n7. **Connect UI to API**: Write code to take input from your UI, pass it to your ChatGPT API function, and display the response in your UI.\n\n8. **Implement Send Function**: Write code to be triggered when the send button is pressed. This should take the current text in the input field, pass it to your ChatGPT function, and update the display with the response.\n\n9. **Implement Clear Function**: Write code to be triggered when the clear button is pressed. This should clear both the input field and the conversation display.\n\n10. **Test Application**: Run your application and test its functionality. Ensure that messages can be sent and received correctly, and that the clear function works as expected.\n\n11. **Debug and Refine**: If any issues are found during testing, debug and refine your code as necessary.\n\n12. **Prepare for Distribution**: Once you're satisfied with your application, prepare it for distribution. This might involve generating a standalone executable, packaging it into an installer, or uploading it to a repository."
